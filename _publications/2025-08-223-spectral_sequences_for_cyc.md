excerpt: 'We construct a number of new spectral sequences for calculating the cyclic cohomology $$HC^*_{dg}(A)$$ of a differential graded algebra (dga). With these spectral sequences we prove some results about the low dimensional cyclic cohomology and demonstrate the existence of various maps between $$HC^*_{dg}(A)$$ and $$HH^*_{dg}(A)$$. We also briefly introduce variations on Hochschild and cyclic cohomology of a dga, namely the  -th partial Hochschild cohomology and $$n$$-partial cyclic cohomology. Finally, we show how these results can be extended naturally to the dg-category setting. In particular we define the Hochschild and cyclic cohomolgy of dg-categories and show that the spectral sequences we have constructed can be used in this setting as well.'
